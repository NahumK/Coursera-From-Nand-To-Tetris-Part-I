From Nand To Tetris Part I
 ------------------------------------------------

In this project-centered course you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up.This fascinating journey is divided into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.

No physical materials are needed, since we will build the computer on our own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools are freely supplied
